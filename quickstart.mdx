## Get started in three steps

Integrate Return2Play API into your application quickly and easily.

### Step 1: Get your API credentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Sign up for API access">
    To use the Return2Play API, you'll need to sign up for an account and get your API credentials.
    
    Visit our [dashboard](https://dashboard.return2play.com) to create an account and obtain your API key.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Test the API">
    Once you have your API key, you can test the API using curl or any HTTP client:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.return2play.com/health" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    <Tip>Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Make your first API call

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="Get player status">
    Retrieve injury status for a specific player:

      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"player_id": "12345"}'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Get all players">
    Retrieve data for all players in our database:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Quick Start

Get up and running with the R2P Prediction API in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests
- A tool to make HTTP requests (curl, Postman, or your preferred client)

## Step 1: Check API Health

First, let's verify the API is running:

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl -X GET https://ifpwy9pbk0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/health
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-03T16:58:44.335Z",
  "service": "R2P Prediction API (Test)",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Step 2: Get All Players

Retrieve a list of all NFL players with their injury data:

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl -X GET https://ifpwy9pbk0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/players
```
</RequestExample>

This will return a comprehensive list of all players with their injury status, position, and other details.

## Step 3: Check a Specific Player

Get detailed injury information for a specific player:

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"player_id":"b4af6462-3e3a-49d5-9d96-482ad9f3c0c8"}' \
  https://ifpwy9pbk0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/player
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Player status retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "player_name": "Kadarius Toney",
    "status": "Ready for Play",
    "reported_date": "2024-09-10",
    "injury": "Ankle",
    "team": null,
    "position": "WR",
    "injury_score": "4"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Understanding the Data

### Player Status Values

- **"Ready for Play"** - Player is healthy and available
- **"0-1 week"** - Expected return within a week
- **"1-2 weeks"** - Expected return in 1-2 weeks
- **"2-3 weeks"** - Expected return in 2-3 weeks
- **"3-4 weeks"** - Expected return in 3-4 weeks
- **"4-6 weeks"** - Expected return in 4-6 weeks
- **"6-8 weeks"** - Expected return in 6-8 weeks
- **"Out for this season"** - Season-ending injury

### Injury Score Guide

| Score Range | Severity | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 0-10 | Low | Minor injuries, likely to play |
| 11-30 | Moderate | Questionable status |
| 31-60 | High | Doubtful to play |
| 61+ | Very High | Out for extended period |

## JavaScript Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function to check if a player is injured:

```javascript
async function checkPlayerInjury(playerId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://ifpwy9pbk0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/player', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ player_id: playerId })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
      const player = data.data;
      const isInjured = player.status !== 'Ready for Play';
      
      return {
        name: player.player_name,
        isInjured,
        status: player.status,
        injury: player.injury,
        position: player.position
      };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

// Usage
const playerStatus = await checkPlayerInjury('b4af6462-3e3a-49d5-9d96-482ad9f3c0c8');
console.log(playerStatus);
```

## Python Example

Here's a Python example using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests
import json

def get_player_status(player_id):
    url = "https://ifpwy9pbk0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/player"
    payload = {"player_id": player_id}
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    
    if data['success']:
        player = data['data']
        return {
            'name': player['player_name'],
            'is_injured': player['status'] != 'Ready for Play',
            'status': player['status'],
            'injury': player['injury'],
            'position': player['position']
        }
    
    return None

# Usage
player_status = get_player_status('b4af6462-3e3a-49d5-9d96-482ad9f3c0c8')
print(player_status)
```
